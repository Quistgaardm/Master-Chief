**In the fell clutch of circumstance, I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance, my head is bloody, but unbowed.**

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
### More stuff

got no idea what to 

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
